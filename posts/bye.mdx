### Where are you?
At the time of writing this, I've decided to take a break from the internet indefinitely <br />
This includes any and all platforms I may use, including Discord, Signal, and so on

### When will you be back?
No clue <br />
I estimate anywhere from 2 weeks to 3 months <br />
If I go beyond that timeframe, I'm *probably* dead <br />

### Emergency contacts
If you have my number, you may try giving me a call <br />
Otherwise, deal with it

### Conclusion
That's basically all I had to say <br />
I figured it's easier to do this than to message you all individually <br />
This also serves as a test run of my blog post system <br />
It's far from perfect, but I don't really care anymore

Goodbye
